It's currently under development so you may find some bugs in the .md files and consider too that a lot of infos are missing.

I'm trying to get it updated as regularly as possible.

        Tag::h1( "Welcome to my web app !" )
        .Tag::h2 ( "You can nest elements"
            .Tag::a("as easy as this"))));

// Add headers at any place, nevermind if your server has buffer activated
$app.header("Content-Type: text/html");

// Never wonder again about placing elements in the right order, just say where you want it to be
$app.body.before(
    Tag::span( {class => 'navbar'}
        "Some elements into my navbar")
        .$app::render("app-logo")); // Render ressources easily
        
// Oops we forgot to include some CSS/JS ... nevermind

## [Avalam AI Game](https://github.com/snwfdhmp/avalam-ai-game)

### Links :

- [repo](https://github.com/snwfdhmp/avalam-ai-game)

### Description :

While the UI is totally broken (I tried SDL but this is definetly something I don't want to work with), the back-end part with operator overload inheritance over abstract class polymorphism, may be interesting. I plan to export this class-system to build a cross-platform simple UI library for C++.

```C++
// (GC means Graphical Component)

auto window = new GCWindow (); // creates a Window object

// Let's create 2 different displays (views)
auto menu = new GCDisplay();
auto credits = new GCDisplay();

// Let's create 3 graphical components ...
auto button = new GC(); 
auto title = new GC();
auto content = new GC();

// ... and add them into their corresponding view
menu.addGC(button);
credits.addGC(title);
credits.addGC(content);

// Let's show a display ...
window.show(menu);

// ... wait for 3 seconds
window.wait(3000);

// ... and change to another
window.show(credits);
```

This small example does not explain stuff like onClick(), onMouseOver() and other methods overloading, this will come when I'll have the time to.
